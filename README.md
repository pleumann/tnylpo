# `tnylpo`
## What is this?
`tnylpo` allows the execution of programs written for CP/M-80
version 2.2 under Unixy operating systems. It has been tested
under
* Linux
  * Debian 8 i386, powerpc; Debian 9 amd64; Debian 10-12 amd64, i386; Debian 13 amd64
  * Pi OS (Debian 13) 32-bit, 64-bit
  * Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS, 24.04 LTS
  * CentOS 6 i386; CentOS 7
  * Rocky Linux 9.1
  * Slackware 14.2 i386
  * Alpine Linux 3.22.2 i386, amd64,
* FreeBSD (12.0 amd64; 13.0 i386; 14.2 amd64),
* NetBSD (8.0 i386, sparc, vax; 9.2 amd64, sparc64, i386; 10.0 i386, sparc;
10.1 amd64),
* OpenBSD (6.4, 6.7, 6.9, 7.6 i386),
* Solaris (7 sparc; 9 sparc, i386; 10 i386, amd64),
* AIX (5.3), and
* Mac OS X (10.5 powerpc; 10.6; 10.7; 10.9; 10.11; 10.13; 10.15; 11-15 amd64,
arm64; 26 arm64),

but should need little to no modifications to run under any other
reasonably recent system. The companion program `tnylpo-convert`
converts text files to and from the CP/M format.
## More details, please!
Read the included man page,
[`tnylpo.1`](https://gitlab.com/gbrein/tnylpo/wikis/tnylpo.1);
you can format and read
it with the command
```sh
nroff -man tnylpo.1 | less
```
## What is a man page? And what is CP/M-80?
Move on, there is nothing to see for you. Go play with your
smartphone, kiddy.

O.K., that answer was elitist and ageist. Let's try again.

"A man page (short for manual page) is a form of software documentation
usually found on a Unix or Unix-like operating system. Topics covered
include computer programs (including library and system calls), formal
standards and conventions, and even abstract concepts. A user may invoke
a man page by issuing the man command." (from the Wikipedia, s.v.
[man page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page), 2020-08-26)

CP/M is a simple operating system for early microcomputers which was
popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Its most important variant
targets computers based on Intel's 8080/8085 and Zilog's Z80 processors
and is therefore called CP/M-80, while CP/M-86, CP/M-68K, and CP/M-8000
target Intel's 8086, Motorola's 68000, and Zilog's Z8000 processors,
respectively. (cf. Wikipedia, s.v. [CP/M](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M))
## What makes this program special?
I didn't do much research into other CP/M emulators, so I cannot tell you
what makes `tnylpo` stand out from the crowd (and there is quite a crowd of
CP/M emulators, see e.g. the [emulators page on Thomas Scherrer's Z80
pages](http://www.z80.info/z80emu.htm)).

I wrote `tnylpo` for my own use, and I primarily need to run CP/M compilers
and assemblers on more recent machines. I designed my emulator to integrate
CP/M software as tightly as possible into the Unix command line, since this
is my preferred working environment.

Consequently, if you are in search of the authentic look-and-feel of
CP/M back in its heyday, `tnylpo` is probably not what you are
looking for. (Well, things change. If you are interested in this, you
might chance a look into the subdirectory `tcpm`.)
If on the other hand you want to play with old CP/M source
code and compilers without having access to a CP/M computer, if you do not
want to wait for the ages it takes the tired iron to create an executable,
or if you simply prefer to edit your CP/M sources with your favourite
Unix editor instead of CP/M's `ed`,
you might find `tnylpo` useful. Likewise, it may be the right tool if
you need to access e.g. old dBase II databases or WordStar text files,
especially if they contain data in some half-forgotten ASCII variant.

In short, `tnylpo`
* supports the full Z80 instruction set (including undocumented
instructions and features)
* supports (or at least tolerates) all BDOS calls of CP/M 2.2 and a few
taken from CP/M 3 (mostly for date and time handling)
* supports all character handling BIOS calls of CP/M 2.2
* provides a TPA size of 63.5KB
* maps CP/M file operations to operations on files in the Unix file
system
* allows you to map up to 16 CP/M drives to arbitrary Unix directories
* supports read-only drives
* maps the character set of the Unix locale (usually UTF-8) to
a user-configurable single byte CP/M character set for console (and
optionally, for printer, punch, and reader) I/O
* provides a built-in curses based emulation of the DEC VT52
terminal for full-screen applications (with extensions such as
eight bit characters, an alternate character set, insert/delete line
commands, character attributes, VT100 box drawing characters, and
color support)
* shields CP/M programs from terminal window resizing
* allows to combine CP/M programs with Unix shell redirections and pipelines.
## Which CP/M applications work with `tnylpo`?
All well-behaved CP/M 2.2 software (i.e. software conforming to the CP/M 2.2
API and not using proprietary OS extensions, not accessing hardware directly,
and refraining from BIOS based disk accesses) should function under `tnylpo`;

Notes:
1. needs to be run with (resp. some features need) the `-s` (full-screen console) option.
2. needs to be run with the `-n` (don't close files) option.
3. as I said, go play with your smartphone, kiddy!
## How do I build it?
Make sure you have a version of the `ncurses` library supporting
wide characters and its headers installed
(I used version 5.9 during development). You'll need a C compiler
supporting the C99
standard. The `makefile` contains GNU `make` features, so you'll
need GNU `make` to use it (but then it is trivial and short enough that you
can easily modify it to suit your favourite `make` utility).

Building under Linux, Mac OS X, and Free/Open/NetBSD is as easy as entering
```sh
make
```
(resp. `gmake` on platforms with a non-GNU primary `make` utility). Under
AIX and Solaris, you will have to edit `makefile` first, see the notes below.
### Platform-specific notes:
*Mac OS X*: The Xcode Command Line Tools (which can be installed with the
command `xcode-select --install`) are sufficient to compile `tnylpo`,
and the `ncurses` library is available by default.

There seems to be a `ncurses` incompatibility between Mac OS X 15 (Sequoia)
and preceeding OS versions: In certain circumstances, `tnylpo` executables
compiled on an earlier OS version display all printable characters as `^@`
on the full screen console under Mac OS X 15 (the line orientated console
is not affected). Finally, I was able to reproduce this reported issue after
updating my M1 MacBook Pro from Mac OS X 13 (Ventura) to Mac OS X 15, but the
exact mechanics of this bug still elude me. Fortunately, the problem is easily
fixed by recompiling `tnylpo` (`make veryclean ; make`) under Mac OS X 15
(after an OS update, be sure to update the Xcode Command Line Tools as well).
 
*Linux*: On most distributions, the packages `build-essential` and
`libncurses-dev` (and optionally, `git`) resp. their dependencies provide
everything needed for building `tynlpo`.

*FreeBSD*: Installing the binary packages `ncurses` and `gmake` (and
optionally, `git`) with `pkg install` will enable you to use the provided
`makefile` to build `tnylpo`.

*NetBSD*: `gmake` (and `git`) are available as binary packages, and
can be installed with the command `pkgin install`. The provided `makefile`
uses the native C compiler and `curses` library, which is sufficiently
compatible with `ncurses`.

*OpenBSD*: `ncurses` and the C compiler are part of the core OpenBSD system,
and `gmake` (and `git`) can be installed as binary packages with `pkg_add`.

*AIX*: Depending on the available C compilers and the location of `ncurses`
in the file system, you will have to adapt the AIX
specific portion of `makefile`, especially  the variables `CC`, `NCURSESROOT`
`CFLAGS`, and `LIBS`. As provided, `makefile` will work for 32 bit AIX 5.3
(reflecting the limitations of my RS/6000 7043 Model 150 development system)
with the freeware packages `ncurses`, `ncurses-devel`, `make`, and `gcc`
(and their numerous dependencies) from
[oss4aix.org](http://oss4aix.org/download/compatible/aix53/).

*Solaris*: Depending on your Solaris version, your hardware, your compiler,
and the place where `ncurses` lives on your system, you will have to adapt the
Solaris portion in `makefile`. Unmodified, it will attempt to build
`tnylpo` for a UltraSparc IIe running Solaris 9 using the Forte 7 Developer
compiler and the `ncurses` package from the
[OpenCSW project](https://www.opencsw.org). As a guideline, two alternative
configurations (32 bit Sparc, IA32 with `gcc`) are included as comments.

Solaris releases prior to Solaris 10 come with UTF-8 fonts
containing double-width box drawing characters which `tnylpo` cannot handle
correctly. On these systems, `CFLAGS` should contain `-DOLD_SOLARIS`
to approximate the box drawing characters in the built-in `tnylpo`
character set using ASCII characters.
## How do I install it?
Copy the resulting binaries `tnylpo` and `tnylpo-convert` to a
directory in your `PATH`
(e.g. `/usr/local/bin`) and the man pages
[`tnylpo.1`](https://gitlab.com/gbrein/tnylpo/wikis/tnylpo.1) and
[`tnylpo-convert.1`](https://gitlab.com/gbrein/tnylpo/wikis/tnylpo-convert.1) to
an appropriate directory in your `man` hierarchy (e.g.
`/usr/local/share/man/man1`).
```sh
man tnylpo
```
will then tell you how to get your CP/M-80 programs running.

The subdirectory `mine` contains a simple text-based CP/M game which
can be used to test/demonstrate `tnylpo`.
## Is `tnylpo` available as a binary package?
Currently, I do not provide `tnylpo` in binary form for any platform.

FreeBSD has added `tnylpo` to its package collection
at the end of 2020, so if you are running a supported release of FreeBSD,
you can easily add `tnylpo` to your system by issuing the command
`pkg install tnylpo`.

OpenBSD added `tnylpo` to its package collection
after its OpenBSD 6.8 release, so users of 6.8-current (or later) may
install `tnylpo` with the command `pkg_add tnylpo`.

[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) provides a `tnylpo` package for
MacOS users. If you have MacPorts installed, you can add `tnylpo` to your
system by typing `sudo port install tnylpo` in a terminal window.

Please bear in mind that these binary packages are often based on
outdated versions of the `tnylpo` source code; to get the latest
features and bug fixes, I recommend compiling your own binaries from the
source.
## I don't want to read 1000+ lines just to run a program!
All CP/M program and data file names are expected in lower case;
files called `TURBO.COM`, `M80.COM`, or `PGRM.MAC` need to be
renamed to `turbo.com`, `m80.com`, resp. `pgrm.mac` to be accessible
by tnylpo.

Most non-interactive CP/M programs (compilers, assembers, linkers etc.)
can be run by simply prefixing `tnylpo` to the CP/M command line, e.g.
```
tnylpo m80 =pgrm/z
tnylpo l80 pgrm/n,pgrm/e
tnylpo pgrm
```
Without any configuration file and command line options, `tnylpo` will
use the current Unix working directory as CP/M drive A: (where
CP/M programs and all required files must reside) and default
to the line-orientated console device. Be sure to quote characters
like `$`, `*` and `?` in your CP/M command line, or the Unix shell will
try to expand them.

Full-screen applications may be run using the `-s` option (to be
useful, they must be configured for the VT52 terminal), e.g.
```
tnylpo -s turbo
```

To use more advanced features of `tnylpo` (multiple disk drives,
custom character sets, or a log file) or to avoid typing multiple
command line options, a configuration file is needed; a model
configuration file for a full-screen application with a short
explanation may be found in the `EXAMPLES` section near the end
of the man page.
## What is the legal situation?
`tnylpo` is Open Source under a BSD-style license (see `LICENSE`);
apart from that, feel free to use it, modify it, or sell it for big
money to whoever is stupid enough to buy it. This program was written
by me from scratch and doesn't contain any third party code.
## Who wrote this crap?
Georg Brein. If you cannot resist the urge to contact me
about `tnylpo`, send mail to `tnylpo@gmx.at`.
